# Javascript-challenge

For this project, I built a webpage using JavaScript and JavaScript's D3 library to display data on UFO sightings around the world. The user has the ability to filter through the data and view sightings based on date, city, state, country, and/or shape. You can view the project at https://dunkin-gray.github.io/Javascript-challenge/.

index.html:

My html file that links to my javascript app and data.
static folder:

static/css/style.css | My css file that adds dynamic styling to the page.
static/js/data.js | The data used to populate my table.
static/js/app.js | The JavaScript app that links the data and adds filtering functions.
static/images | Commericially available images used to design the page.
